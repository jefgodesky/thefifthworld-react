# The Fifth World

One day this will replace [thefifthworld](https://github.com/jefgodesky/thefifthworld) as the code that runs [the Fifth World website](https://thefifthworld.com), but it's not ready yet. This is a universal React app (meaning it's using React both on the front end and the server using Node) that nonetheless embraces progressive enhancement (something you don't usually see in React development, and in fact something a lot of React developers will flat-out tell you is impossible, but this project exists, so those people are clearly wrong).
